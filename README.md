 <summary><h3>üóª My DevOps Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey as a DevOps Engineer began with a fascination for Cloud tech and Automation. I got curious about the Cloud after my first year of mechanical engineering at university, and that curiosity has been my compass ever since.

During a summer break, I deepened my skills through the AWS re/Start program. There, I learned about Linux, Python, Networking, Databases, Security, CI/CD, and AWS. Alongside this, I explored Terraform and applied it to various projects.

After the bootcamp, I focused on solutions architecture. I built a serverless reminder app using AWS tools and created a 3-tier system on AWS with Terraform, automating it using GitLab CI/CD. I also dove into Docker and Kubernetes, using them in different projects.

Recently, I did a deep dive into Python building a stronger foundation in my programming skills. I also took on The Cloud Resume challenge, combining AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, and Python skills from the past year. This project showcased my progress and ability to blend different technologies.

Looking ahead, I'm driven by my commitment to keep learning and evolving in the DevOps field. Each step forward excites me as I explore new technologies and their potential.
