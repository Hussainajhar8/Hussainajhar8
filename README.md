 <summary><h3>ðŸ—» Ajhar's DevOps Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my journey as a DevOps Engineer with a passion for Cloud technologies and Automation. My curiosity had brought me to the Cloud after finishing my first year of mechanical engineering at university and I was hooked ever since. I decided to take advantage of my summer break to dive deeper into the field by completing the AWS re/Start program, where I gained a strong understanding of Linux, Python, Networking, Databases, Security, CI/CD, and AWS. Simultaneously, I started to learn Terraform on my own and applied it to various projects. After completing the bootcamp, I decided to focus more on the solutions architect associate material and work on various projects to improve my skills. I created a serverless reminder app using AWS Lambda, SNS, and SES, and also built a 3-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform and automated the process with GitLab CI/CD pipeline. I then moved on to learning Docker and Kubernetes and have been implementing them in various projects. I've been continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in the field of DevOps and looking forward to keep learning and implementing new technologies.
