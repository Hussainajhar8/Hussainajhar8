 <summary><h3>üóª My DevOps Journey</h3></summary>

**About Me**

My journey into DevOps is driven by a genuine fascination with cloud technology and a passion for automation. It began during my mechanical engineering studies at Queen Mary University, where I discovered the AWS re/Start program. This opportunity profoundly shaped my career path.

**Education and Skills Development**

Enrolling in the AWS re/Start program opened my eyes to the vast potential of cloud computing. The comprehensive curriculum covered Linux, Python, networking, databases, security, and CI/CD pipelines, laying a solid foundation for my future in DevOps.

Inspired by the transformative power of the cloud, I shifted my focus from traditional academia to becoming a DevOps Engineer. Since then, I have committed to continuous learning, leveraging every opportunity to deepen my expertise and refine my skills.

**Projects and Hands-On Experience**

One particularly enlightening project was creating a serverless reminder app using AWS tools and developing a 3-tier system on AWS with Terraform. These hands-on experiences not only enhanced my technical abilities but also instilled a deep appreciation for automation and infrastructure as code.

The Cloud Resume Challenge highlighted the importance of efficiency and scalability in modern IT environments. By deploying my portfolio website on AWS, I encountered and overcame obstacles related to manual tasks. Embracing DevOps principles, I implemented CI/CD pipelines and Terraform to automate the deployment process, resulting in a streamlined workflow that allowed for seamless updates and more time for innovation.

**Future Aspirations**

Looking ahead, my goals in the DevOps field are twofold:
1. **Professional Growth**: I aim to become a respected leader within my tech community, sharing insights and fostering a culture of collaboration and growth.
2. **Certifications**: I am committed to pursuing industry-recognized certifications, such as Kubernetes Administrator, to enhance my skill set and stay updated with emerging trends.

**Personal Interests**

Beyond technology, I find fulfillment in martial arts and exploring the natural world through documentaries and travel. My thirst for knowledge extends to mastering new languages like Arabic and acquiring practical skills like car maintenance.

**Conclusion**

As I continue my DevOps journey, I remain dedicated to personal and professional growth. Embracing each challenge as an opportunity to learn and evolve, I look forward to the adventures that lie ahead with a spirit of curiosity and a commitment to excellence.
