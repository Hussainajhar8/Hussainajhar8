 <summary><h3>üóª My DevOps Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey into DevOps has been driven by a genuine fascination with cloud technology and a relentless pursuit of automation. It all began after a productive first year of my mechanical engineering studies at Queen Mary University, where I encountered the AWS re/Start program, an opportunity that would profoundly shape my career trajectory.

Enrolling in the program opened my eyes to the vast landscape of cloud computing and its transformative potential. From Linux and Python to networking, databases, security, and CI/CD pipelines, I immersed myself in a comprehensive curriculum that laid a solid foundation for my journey ahead.

Inspired by the possibilities unleashed by the cloud, I made the pivotal decision to pivot away from traditional academia and focus my efforts on becoming a DevOps Engineer. Since then, I've committed myself to continuous learning and skills development, leveraging every opportunity to deepen my expertise and refine my craft.

One particularly enlightening project was the creation of a serverless reminder app using AWS tools and the development of a sophisticated 3-tier system on AWS with Terraform. These hands-on experiences not only honed my technical abilities but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the principles of automation and infrastructure as code.

The Cloud Resume Challenge served as a poignant reminder of the importance of efficiency and scalability in modern IT environments. As I endeavoured to deploy my portfolio website on AWS, I encountered familiar hurdles‚Äîtedious manual tasks that stifled productivity. Determined to overcome these obstacles, I embraced the ethos of DevOps, implementing CI/CD pipelines and Terraform to automate the deployment process. The result was a streamlined workflow that allowed for seamless updates and freed up valuable time for innovation.

Looking ahead, my aspirations in the DevOps field are twofold. Professionally, I aim to become a respected leader within my tech community, sharing insights and fostering a culture of collaboration and growth. Additionally, I'm committed to pursuing industry-recognized certifications, such as Kubernetes Administrator, to further enhance my skill set and stay abreast of emerging trends.

Beyond the realm of technology, I find fulfilment in pursuits such as martial arts and exploring the wonders of the natural world through documentaries and travelling. My thirst for knowledge knows no bounds, whether it's mastering a new language like Arabic or acquiring practical skills like car maintenance.

As I continue on my DevOps journey, I remain steadfast in my dedication to personal and professional growth, embracing each challenge as an opportunity to learn and evolve. With a spirit of curiosity and a commitment to excellence, I look forward to the adventures that lie ahead.
